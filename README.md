# Spilt - Pixel art extractor
> A simple tool that allows you to take a pixel art image that has been upscaled or screenshotted at a higher resolution, and extract the original minimum-resolution image.

- Hover the top left or top right corners to view input/output images fullscreen
- The width/height sliders set the original resolution that the source pixel art was at
- Set the height slider to 0 to guess the height automatically based on the width
